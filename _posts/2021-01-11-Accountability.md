I just watched some snippets from Tina Huang's YouTube video "How to learn data science in 2021 (the minimize effort maximize outcome way)".
And it was a delight to discover this content becuase accountability is on my 2021 New Habit list. 
And I can relate to how she does not learn best from just watching a bunch of tutorials.  

Key idea is to keep in mind consequences such as the case when we are in school and given certain tasks to do.
If they do not get finished then there will be consequences -- poor grades/even failing a course. Ahhhhh!
What helps her a lot is actually making her plans to complete certain tasks public. When others know her goals there is expectation.
Then she is able to persist when things get hard when completing projects. In the end, she accomplishes those goals as well as 
not disappointing others nor look like an untrustworthy person. Accountabiity is a game-changer to make sure things get done
and that I can continue to progress in my career goals!
