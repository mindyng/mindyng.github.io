# Metric to Lift:

Total Active Users QoQ/YoY


# Business Problem:

Churn is when customers cut ties with the firm either because of poor customer service or competitive offered a better deal. It is usually measured on a
yearly basis. However, this could be done more frequently if subscriptions renew every month, which is the case for popular mobile service plans.

It is important to figure out what the churn rate is to retain them because the cost of acquiring new customers is far more expensive (5-25x more expensive).

Determining those that are churning can be determined by app sessions, engagements, conversions, chats to customer service, number or cancelled orders to 
name a few. When certain behavior is linked to customer attrition, churn prediction can be implemented for a business to intervene earlier. 

And this would help decrease churn rate, increase total active users YoY and profitability.
