I knew my transition into tech would not be an easy feat, but I did not think it would be _this_ challenging. There is a lot going up against me. One mentor recently reminded me that there are few females in this field.

I am the underdog. 

# Here are my 2021 goals:

One: Be Optimistic
Two: Have Vision
Three: Have Accountability (thanks, mentors!)
Four: Have Passion with What I Do
Five: Conquer tech assessment stage!
Six: Reach goals through with G R I T

Checking this daily to calibrate as well as reviewing this in *362* days to see how I have progressed :D
