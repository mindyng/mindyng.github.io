Came from DMV, USPS and EDD this morning (don't recommend hitting all these at once) and boy, the amount of apathy and cyncisim could have been a little more discrete. It was all over. There were some non-attentive, doing-just-as-told workers who talked down on you and others who looked like they seriously didn't want to be at their job. 

This reminded me that government jobs are to implement set laws. And that they are called to make sure people follow them or else. And this can lack a lot of heart sometimes. I was reminded from these few hours this morning why I want to work for a company where there is a fire-burning passion 
inside of me to offer the best to customers aka P A S S I O N!
