I just came from the DMV, USPS and EDD this morning (don't recommend hitting all these at once) and boy, the amount of apathy and cyncisim could have been a little more discrete. I observed/came in contact with non-attentive, doing-just-as-told workers who talked down on people and who looked like they didn't want to be at their job. 

This reminded me that government jobs are to implement set laws. And that those who work for government agencies are called to make sure people follow them or else. And having this responsibiility can lack a lot of heart sometimes. I was reminded from these few hours this morning why I want to work for a company where there is a fire-burning passion inside of me to offer the best to customers aka be P A S S I O N A T E about my job! It would also be nice because it would feel like I am just having fun which would be a major + :D
