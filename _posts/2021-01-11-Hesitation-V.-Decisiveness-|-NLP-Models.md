NLP was never something I naturally gravitated towards since it seemed so complex. I rather just deal with numerical datasets instead of the ones full of text. It just looked too messy and complex. However, when I started getting involved with "CoronaWhy" an organization that used computers to help classify COVID-19 research papers and created knowledge graphs for information retrieval, my view on NLP started to change. I began to see the power in leveraging computational power to decipher huge bodies of text. And my industry experience at Forethought reinforced NLP being a huge game changer in AI when NLU was used to help automate responses to customer complaints.

Today I am going to wrap up some [NLP modeling](https://www.kaggle.com/mindyng/burnout-modeling) in order to lay down fundamental concepts in NLP. And this will lead to more complex projects and deployments. Also, my affinity towards NLP will be stronger. So let's go!
