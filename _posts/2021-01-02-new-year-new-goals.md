I knew my transition into tech would not be an easy feat, but I did not think it would be _this_ challenging. There is a lot I am up against. One mentor recently reminded me that there are few females in this field.

I am the underdog. 

# Here are my 2021 goals:

1. Be Optimistic
1. Have Vision
1. Have Accountability (thanks, mentors!)
1. Have Passion with What I Do
1. Conquer tech assessment stage!
1. Reach goals by having G R I T

Checking this daily to calibrate as well as reviewing this in **362** days to see how I have progressed :D
