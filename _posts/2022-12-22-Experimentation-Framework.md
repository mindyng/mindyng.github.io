# Metric to Lift:

Business Metric tied to Experiment Hypothesis/Sample Experiment To Infer True Population's Behavior to New Product Feature


# Business Problem:

Too often a new product feature roll out is justified based on 0.01 lift. Though the criteria to assess whether or not a new product feature is a success
requires rigorous statistical assessment. This is to prevent a new product feature from failing expectations when scaled out to the whole user base. And 
therefore preventing lost resources and/or time.

# Hypothesis: 

Conclusion from sample infers proper conclusion when the product is scaled out, an experimentation framework is needed 
to add acceptance criteria for new product feature roll out.

# Analysis Approach:

1. Design experiment
2. Collect and Papare Data
3. Visualize Results
4. Test Hypothesis
5. Conclusion/Caveat
