## Business Problem:

Too often a new product feature roll out is justified based on 0.01 lift. Though the criteria to assess whether or not a new product feature is a success
requires rigorous statistical assessment. This is to prevent a new product feature from failing expectations when scaled out to the whole user base. And 
therefore preventing lost resources and/or time.

## Metric to Lift:

Business Metric tied to Experiment Hypothesis/Sample Experiment To Infer True Population's Behavior to New Product Feature

## Hypothesis: 

Conclusion from sample infers proper conclusion when the product is scaled out, an experimentation framework is needed 
to add acceptance criteria for new product feature roll out.

## Analysis Approach:

1. Design experiment
2. Collect and Papare Data
3. Visualize Results
4. Test Hypothesis
5. Conclusion/Recommendation

## Code

[Experimentation Framework](https://nbviewer.org/github/mindyng/2022-Business-Projects/blob/main/experimentation-framework.ipynb)

## Recommendation: 

Keep using hypothesis testing in order to vet initial results from A/B testing.   

## Conclusion:

Hypothesis testing is a great way to add rigor to experiment results analyses.
At the same time, it is best to make sure there are no data errors upstream such as could happen when a new ML infrastructure is implemented. Also, another piece of advice is to try user surveys to get insight on why experiment results are not turning out as expected.
