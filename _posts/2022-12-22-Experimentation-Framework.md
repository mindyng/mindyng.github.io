# Metric to Lift:

Business Metric tied to Experiment Hypothesis/Sample Experiment Conclusion Matches 100% Roll Out to User Base's Behavior


# Business Problem:

Too often a new product feature roll out is justified based on 0.01 lift. Though the criteria to assess whether or not a new product feature is a success
requires rigorous statistical assessment. This is to prevent a new product feature from failing expectations when scaled out to the whole user base. And 
therefore lost resources and time.

# Hypothesis: 

In order to ensure an experiment's conclusion correctly infers the same conclusion when the product is scaled out, an experimentation framework is needed 
to add acceptance criteria for new product feature roll out.
