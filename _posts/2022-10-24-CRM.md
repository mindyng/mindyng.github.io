Business Problem:
During my time at Mercari, I noticed there were a bunch of high-grossing categories that were collectibles. If this made up a high percentage of GMV then it would be business savvy to have a better understanding of the buyers and even sellers in these categories.
Over at eBay, there are designated managers for each item category that know specific release dates or when possible peak sales would happen within categories. This ties closely to Customer
Relationship Management which helps the business set metrics on how well they are taking care of their customers/user base. Given that not every user has the same relationship to the business, best thing to do is to 
determine which metrics push those most engaged sellers to the forefront of the market (give their listed items top rankings in impressions), match them with buyers who are frequent purchasers and then bringing along with them heavy consumers as well.
And these types of sellers are determined based on setting purchase behavior metrics on users and seeing on the scale's metric where they stand to determine amount of favoritism is given to incentivize marketplace loyalty.
