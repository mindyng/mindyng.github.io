The Pandemic has had a toll on society with spikes of severely unhealthy individuals and deaths over a short amount of time. It has caused a hampered health care system, paralyzed economy, social unrest, mistrust of government and increased mental issues. This is where healthcare workers come in and heal. Unfortunately, the demand for care with limited personnel and PPE has taken a toll on those who are supposed to uphold health. Many of them are experiencing crisis fatigue/post-traumatic stress disorder because the oath they made entering into their profession to give the best patient care is near impossible these days. 

Though good patient care is achievable if healthcare workers' health are assessed and proper intervention is in place. The need is clear based on institutions carrying out institutions that went into cause of crisis fatigue and what has helped lessen or mitigate it.

I have presented survey data as graphs for quick consumption on specific burnout indicators as well as actitives that have helped healthcare workers.

Afterwords, using those indicators for burnout I used MockaRoo to complete a mock dataset in order to build a theoreticcal burnout classification model. The idea was to get the machine learning pipeline set up and feed in actual data at a later date. 

The model's best performance was an F-1 score of 0.68 where an ideal score is 1. Nearly 30% of cases are misclassified as a false positive. There were no false negatives! Risk of being false always needs to be assessed. The cost of incorrectly diagnosing someone who is burntout who really is not as a lesser cost than missing someone who is actually burntout.

This [initial exploration](https://www.kaggle.com/mindyng/nyc-healthcare-workers-burnout) allowed me to see from real survey data what the numerical breakdown for burnout causes were and what has relieved anxiety/stress. 

Next step is to scrape actual tweets from nurses, healthcare workers who have been hit the hardest (as data reveals) and perform data analysis as well as build a more accurate NLP classification model for burnout.
