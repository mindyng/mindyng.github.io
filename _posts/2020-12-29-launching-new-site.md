Well, finally got around to putting this website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually was a lot easier than I thought it was going to be thanks to [this nice guy's tutorial](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/).
