Recent news is not getting any better. 1 in 3 people in LA are infected. Health care workers continue to suffer through crisis fatigue.
Now hospital directors are sending out incentives - retention bonuses in order to retain nurses and others who are borderline going to leave
healthcare. It is getting to be too much. Nurses, doctors, those on the frontlines deserve better.

I am going to learn some deep learning algorithms in order to build more accurate models so that these healthcare workers can be treated themselves-- earlier.
