I knew my transition into tech would not be an easy feat, but I did not think it would be *this* challenging. There is a lot going up against me. One mentor recently reminded me that there are few females in this field.

I am the underdog. 

# Here are my 2021 goals:

1)Be Optimistic
2)Have vision
3)Have accountability (thanks, mentors!)
4)Be passionate
5)Conquer tech assessment stage!
6)Pull through with G R I T
