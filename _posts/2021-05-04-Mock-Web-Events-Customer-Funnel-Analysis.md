I have been wanting to explore streamed events post-ingestion. Tracking a customer's user behavior in real-time is extremely valuable because it allows you to see 
instant reponse to a new product feature or even intervene immediately when you see a customer possibly churn.

Though this is the standard data that comes into a company's system, testing a data pipeline's transformation and BI layer does not need code committed to 
Production. This is where mock event data comes in. In order to create some, I knew I had to find some online or create some on my own. And I ended up bumping into
this wonderful [post]('https://towardsdatascience.com/simulating-web-events-7199bf8afcfd').
