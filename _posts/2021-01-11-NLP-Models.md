NLP was never something I naturally gravitated towards since it seemed so complex. I rather just deal with numerical datasets
instead of the ones full of text. It just looked too messy and complex. However, when I started getting involved with "CoronaWhy" 
an organization that used computers to help classify COVID-19 research papers and created knowledge graphs for information retrieval, 
my view on NLP started to change. I began to see the power in leveraging computation power to decipher huge bodies of text.
And my industry experience at Forethought reinforced NLP being a huge game changer in AI when NLU was used to help automate responses 
to customer complaints. 

Today I am going to do wrap up some NLP modeling in order to lay down that foundation in NLP as well as increase confidence in my
knowledge of it. And this will lead to more complext projects and deployments. Let's go!
