			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Educational and research experience in Genetics and Life Sciences along with extensive project work in data analysis and machine learning. These experiences have given me the ability to think empirically and instilled in me an innovative, breakthrough mindset. By working with large-scale data management, I mine unstructured and structured data to tell the story. Additionally, I use mathematics, statistics and visualizations to aid in economic decision-making as well as for predictive choice behavior.<p>

			<p>I empathize with customers to relentlessly meet their needs by being a collaborative thought-partner to stakeholders. 



				I hunger for business' growth through proactive exploration of ambiguous, complex problems and providing creative data recommendations to inform strategy. 
				
				
				
				I am passionate about user journeys, product innovation and defining success metrics. I am a data journalist to diverse disciplines and levels telling the business story of how a product is solving real issues. 
				
				
				
				I love data modeling, visualization, experimentation, statistical methods, forecasting, optimizing processes, teaching and managing up.</p>
