			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>Educational and research experience in Genetics and Life Sciences along with extensive project work in data analysis and machine learning. 
				I have worked for an early-stage B2B SaaS start-up and a small-sized C2C E-commerce company.
				These experiences have given me the ability to think empirically and instilled in me an innovative, breakthrough mindset. 
				By working with large-scale data, I mine unstructured and structured data to tell the story. 
				Additionally, I use mathematics, statistics and visualizations to aid in economic decision-making along with predictive choice behavior.<p>

			<p>I empathize with customers to relentlessly meet their needs by being a collaborative thought-partner to stakeholders. 
				I hunger for business' growth through proactive exploration of ambiguous, complex problems and providing creative data recommendations to influence strategy. 
				I am passionate about user journeys, defining success metrics and product innovation. I am a data journalist to diverse disciplines and levels telling the 
				business story of how a product is solving real customer issues. 
				I love experimentation, data modeling, visual analytics, statistical methods, forecasting, optimizing processes and growth opportunities.</p>
